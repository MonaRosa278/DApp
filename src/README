# DBank Application - Candid UI Interaction Guide

## Introduction

This guide explains how to use the Candid UI for interacting with the `DBank` application, a simple banking system built in Motoko for the Internet Computer (IC) environment.

## Prerequisites

- DFINITY Canister SDK installed.
- Basic knowledge of Motoko and the Internet Computer platform.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

Ensure you have the `DBank` application code in your local environment.

### 2. Start a Local Internet Computer Replica

Use the DFINITY Canister SDK to start a local IC replica:

```shell
dfx start --background
```

### 3. Deploy Your Canister

Deploy the `DBank` canister to the local IC replica:

```shell
dfx deploy
```

## Using Candid UI with DBank

### Access the Candid UI

After deploying the canister, use the provided canister ID to access the Candid UI:

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/candid?canisterId=<your-canister-id>
```

Replace `<your-canister-id>` with the actual canister ID.

### Interact with DBank Functions

In the Candid UI, you can call various functions of the `DBank` application:

- **Top Up (`topUp`)**: Add funds by passing a float value.
- **Withdraw (`withdraw`)**: Withdraw funds by specifying the amount as a float.
- **Check Balance (`checkBalance`)**: View the current balance, which returns a float.
- **Compound Interest (`compound`)**: Apply compound interest to the current balance.

## Troubleshooting

If you face issues:

- Ensure the local IC replica is actively running.
- Confirm that the canister is correctly deployed with the correct canister ID.
- Check the console for any error messages or logs.

This README provides a clear and concise guide for users to interact with the `DBank` application using the Candid UI on a local Internet Computer replica. Remember to update the `<your-canister-id>` with the specific canister ID generated during your deployment process.
